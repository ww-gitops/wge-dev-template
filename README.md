# Template for deploying WGE Cluster

This repository contains the template for deploying a WGE cluster. Use this repository template to create a new repository and follow the instructions below to deploy a WGE cluster.

On a MacBook it is designed to use the Docker Kubernetes deployed from Docker Dashboard but can be used with any Kubernetes cluster. On Linux it will create a Kind cluster.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required for local cluster)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (required by various scripts)
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/) (required by various scripts)
- [vault cli](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install) (required by various scripts)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (required by various scripts)
- [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) (required by various scripts)
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/source/) (required to generate cluster certificate)

## Optional

- [gitops](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/next/installation/weave-gitops/#install-the-gitops-cli) (optional only required for GitOps CLI deployments)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) (optional, only for Linux and local Kind deployments)
- [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) (optional, only for AWS deployments)
- [custerctl](https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started.html#install-clusterctl) (optional, only for Cluster API deployments)
- [clusterawsadm](https://cluster-api-aws.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started.html#install-clusterawsadm) (optional, only for Cluster API  AWS deployments)
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (optional, only for AWS deployments)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) (optional)
- [multipass](https://multipass.run/) (optional, only for multipass deployments)
- htpasswd - required for generating prometheus password, optional.

## Setup

Once you have created your own repository using this template, you will need to update the `.envrc` file with the correct values for your environment.

If you are using a MacBook start or reset the Kubernetes cluster using the Docker Dashboard. If you are using Linux the `setup.sh` script will create a Kind cluster.

Copy the `resources/github-secrets.sh.sample` file to `resources/github-secrets.sh` and update the values for your GitHub organization.

In order to use the shared functions and global configuration, you will need to clone two additional repos alongside the repo you created from this template:

```bash
cd ../ && git clone https://github.com/ww-gitops/global-config && git clone https://github.com/ww-gitops/gitops-wge-utils
```

Once these are in place, the shared functions will be available on your `PATH`, via the `.envrc` file via `direnv`, once you CD into the directory

If you want to use OIDC to login to the WGE GUI you will need to configure your GitHub organization for OIDC and add the client keys to the `resources/github-secrets.sh` file. This is optional, the setup script will generate a random password for the `wge-admin` user and store it in the `resources/wge-admin-password.txt` file.

## Deploy

To deploy the WGE cluster run the `setup.sh` script. This will create the WGE cluster and deploy the WGE GUI. If the script fails you can run it again to continue the deployment.

Once Flux has deployed the WGE GUI you can login using the `wge-admin` user and the password in the `resources/wge-admin-password.txt` file or the OIDC login.

## Destroy

To destroy the WGE cluster run the `reset.sh` script. This will destroy the WGE cluster.
